## Introduction
This is a code repository for the **Peter's Portfolio** project.
This website is my personal portfolio. Here you can learn a little bit more about myself and what I do.

My name is Piotr Rzadkowolski and I have been fascinated and involved in coding websites for some time.

I am a self-taught person and I derive my knowledge from people more experienced in the industry. I currently live in Warsaw, and I focus all my free time on developing my skills and learning about new technologies that will make my projects even better.

I am a disciplined person, ready to take up work under stress and the need to constantly improve my professional qualifications. I am characterized by responsibility and the ability to work in a team, as well as in independent positions. My advantage is high personal culture, accuracy and innovation.
